  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 
                             Preamble
 
-  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
-software and other kinds of works.
+  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
+software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
+cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
 
   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
-the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
+our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
-software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
-GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
-any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
+software for all its users.
 
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 
-  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
-these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
-certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
-you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
-freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
-or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
-know their rights.
-
-  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
-(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
-giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
-
-  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
-that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
-authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
-changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
-authors of previous versions.
-
-  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
-modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
-can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
-protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
-pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
-use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
-have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
-products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
-stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
-of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
-
-  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
-States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
-software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
-avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
-make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
-patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
+  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights

+  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
+improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
+receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
+incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
+encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
+software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
+The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
+letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
+source code to the public.
+
+  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
+ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
+to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
+provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
+users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
+a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
+code of the modified version.
+
+  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
+published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
+a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
+released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
+this license.

 # Tunnelvision
 
 Tunnelvision is an experimental tensor viewer for IPython environments based on Voxel.
 
 ## Installation
-Tunnelvision requires Python 3.7+.
+Tunnelvision requires Python 3.7+. Wheels are _only_ available for MacOS (x86_64) and Linux for now.
 
 To install Tunnelvision, run:
 
 ```bash
 pip install tunnelvision
 ```
+
+## Quick Start
+The API of tunnelvision is very similar to that of [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). Tunnelvision is a 5D tensor viewer that requires tensors to have the following format: _Batch_ x _Depth_ x _Height_ x _Width_ x _Channels_, where channels can be 1 (grayscale/monochrome) or 3 (RGB). You can quickly plot (medical) images using:
+
+```python
+import numpy as np
+import tunnelvision as tv
+
+arr = np.random.randint(0, 2048, (2, 3, 224, 224, 1), dtype=np.uint16)
+tv.show(arr)
+```
+
+More advanced plots with segmentation overlays (or colormaps in general) can be created as follows:
+```python
+ax = tv.Axes(figsize=(512, 512))
+ax.imshow(arr1)
+ax.imshow(arr2, cmap="seg")
+ax.show()
+```
+
+[Pyvoxel](https://github.com/pyvoxel/pyvoxel) has support for tunnelvision as well, which allows you to plot images with their correct orientation and spacing, without having to manually set those in the configuration:
+
+```python
+import voxel as vx
+
+mv = vx.load("../data/ct/")
+tv.show(mv)
+```
+
+## VS Code Remote
+To use tunnelvision through VS Code remote, we need forward an arbitrary available port to the tunnelvision-server. Once you have forwarded a port from the `ports` pane within VS Code, make sure to add it to your configuration file for tunnelvision:
+
+```yaml
+# ~/.cache/tunnelvision/default_config.yaml
+port: 1337
+```
+
+
```
